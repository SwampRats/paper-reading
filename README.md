# Paper Reading

This repository contains notes on papers read during research for the SWAMP
project.

## Contributing

To share notes on a paper, ensure notes are written in a `.md` file with the name
of the paper in question and stored in the [notes](/notes) directory. For example,
notes on "Deep Shading: Convolutional Neural Networks for Screen-Space Shading,"
should be stored in `notes/deep_shading.md`.

Notes should be taken in a structured form, using the following markdown template.

Feel free to add additional sections to this template to further organize your notes.
Ensure that you have added the paper to the Zotero group `swamp rats`. It
is critical you do so as we need to maintain an accurate list of papers with their
citations.

To have your notes added to the repo, open a pull request and request a review from
a member of the Swamp Rats. This will ensure someone can check that your notes are
well-structured, coherent, useful, and that the paper has been added to Zotero.
